# Concept Learning Using the Find-S Algorithm

This Python script implements the Find-S algorithm for concept learning. The Find-S algorithm is used to find the most specific hypothesis that is consistent with a given set of positive training examples.

## Project Structure

1. **`find_s_algorithm.py`:**
   - The main script containing the implementation of the Find-S algorithm.

2. **`data1.csv`:**
   - The dataset file containing examples. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.

3. **`README.md`:**
   - The README file providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the Find-S algorithm.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Find-S algorithm:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/find-s-algorithm.git
   cd find-s-algorithm
   ```

2. Ensure you have a CSV file named `data1.csv` with the appropriate examples.

3. Run the Find-S algorithm script:
   ```bash
   python find_s_algorithm.py
   ```

   The script will output the most specific hypothesis after processing the examples.

## Find-S Algorithm

The script implements the Find-S algorithm, which finds the most specific hypothesis that is consistent with a given set of positive training examples.

## Example Dataset

The sample dataset used for demonstration is loaded from the `data1.csv` file. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.

## Output

The script prints the most specific hypothesis after processing the positive training examples.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, find issues, or want to enhance the Find-S algorithm, please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
